            <h3>Thai Soup</h3>

                street food specials. A taste sensation loved by all walks of life from the unique Thai street food

            <h3>Salad</h3>
            <p>A salad is a dish consisting of mixed pieces of food, typically with at least one raw ingredient. It is
                often dressed, and is typically served at room temperature or chilled, though some can be served warm.

            <h3>Steak</h3>
            <p>A steak is a meat generally sliced across the muscle fibers, potentially including a bone. It is normally
                grilled, though can also be pan-fried. It is often grilled in an attempt to replicate the flavor of
                steak cooked over the glowing coals of an open fire.
